        The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) assumption is essential to many population genetics models, which assumes
        <br>
        that allele pairs from a given population are random. An HWE test needs to test whether the pairing are random or not.
        <br>
        <br>
        The algorithm was developed by Or Shkuri and Prof. Yoram Louzoun at Bar-Ilan University.
